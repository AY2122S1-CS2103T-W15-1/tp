ClassMATE is a **desktop app designed for CS2101 tutors to manage student contacts and organize them into their tutorial classes and groups, as well as
other administrative matters including recording of students' class participation. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClassMATE can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This guide will get you started on how to create students, classes and groups, 
assigning students to their respective classes and groups and covers other functionalities for users 
such as filtering and searching students. Finally, it will also guide
you through on how you can add class participation marks for your students.

1. Download the latest `classmate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/releases).
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassMATE.
1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui-annotated.png)

## CLI Tutorial

In this section, you will familiarize yourself with the use of CLI to facilitate your experience when using ClassMATE.
All commands would be typed in the **Command-Line Input** located at the top of the user interface as shown in the image below.

![Command Line Input](images/CommandLineInput.png)

Once you have familiarised yourself with the layout of the application, try out some example commands!

Some example commands you can try:
* **`liststu`** : Lists all students. All students currently stored in ClassMATE will be displayed in the **Student Panel**.

* **`addc c/G99 s/Tuesday 2 to 4pm, Friday 2 to 4pm`**: Adds a tutorial class with the code `G99`. The **Tutorial Class Panel** 
should reflect the updated list of tutorial classes including your new class, `G99`.

* **`addstu n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 c/G99`**: Adds a student named `John Doe` to ClassMATE.
The **Student Panel** Should reflect the updated list of students including your new student, `John Doe`.

* **`deletestu 3`**: Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list. 

* **`clear`** : Deletes all students.

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

Once you have attempted these commands, you're ready to go! 

### Command format

This section will help you understand the syntax used to describe the command features in this guide better. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addstu n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* You can add parameters in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can also type `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` for the parameters.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* If you add parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), they will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
