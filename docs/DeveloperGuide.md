### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `ClassListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `TutorialClass` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ClassmateParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ClassmateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `ClassmateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the ClassMATE data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), and all `TutorialClass` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorialClassList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` and `TutorialClass` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<TutorialClass>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ClassMATE`, which `Student` references. This allows `ClassMATE` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ClassMATE data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ClassmateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedClassmate`. It extends `Classmate` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `classmateStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedClassmate#commit()` — Saves the current ClassMATE state in its history.
* `VersionedClassmate#undo()` — Restores the previous ClassMATE state from its history.
* `VersionedClassmate#redo()` — Restores a previously undone ClassMATE state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitClassmate()`, `Model#undoClassmate()` and `Model#redoClassmate()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedClassmate` will be initialized with the initial ClassMATE state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single ClassMATE state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deletestu 5` command to delete the 5th student in the student list. The `deletestu` command calls `Model#commitClassmate()`, causing the modified state of ClassMATE after the `deletestu 5` command executes to be saved in the `classmateStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted ClassMATE state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addstu n/David …​` to add a new student. The `addstu` command also calls `Model#commitClassmate()`, causing another modified ClassMATE state to be saved into the `classmateStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitClassmate()`, so the ClassMATE state will not be saved into the `classmateStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoClassmate()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ClassMATE state, and restores ClassMATE to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ClassMATE state, then there are no previous ClassMATE states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoClassmate()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoClassmate()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ClassMATE to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `classmateStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest ClassMATE state, then there are no undone ClassMATE states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoClassmate()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `liststu`. Commands that do not modify ClassMATE, such as `liststu`, will usually not call `Model#commitClassmate()`, `Model#undoClassmate()` or `Model#redoClassmate()`. Thus, the `classmateStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitClassmate()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `classmateStateList`, all ClassMATE states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ClassMATE.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletestu`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Tutorial Class Management Features
(Contributed by Rushil Ramesh and Vishnu Sundaresan)

ClassMATE allows the user to manage information relevant to the TutorialClass. A User is able to:

1. Add a new tutorial class
2. Delete an existing tutorial class
3. List all existing tutorial class
4. Find all tutorial classes containing a keyword in their classcodes (Coming Soon)
5. View Class Details (Coming Soon)

#### Current Implementation

The class `Classmate` facilitates all operations related to tutorial classes. It maintains a
`UniqueTutorialClassList` of containing all tutorial classes, as well as a `FliteredList` of `TutorialClass` instances reflecting the current state of the 
tutorial class list to be displayed to the user. The `Classmate` conatins a summary
of all the logic of the tutorial class commands (e.g. `AddClassCommand`)  executed on the `UniqueTutorialCLassList`.

The following operations are implemented:
* `Classmate#hasTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Checks if tutorial class is in ClassMATE
* `Classmate#addTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Adds tutorial Class to ClassMATE
* `Classmate#removeTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Deletes existing tutorial class from ClassMATE
* `Classmate#getTutorialClassList()` - Displays entire list of tutorial classes.
* `Model#updateFilteredTutorialClassList(Predicate<TutorialClass> predicate)` - Searches for tutorial class by keyword and displays filtered list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)`,
`Model#addTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)`, `Model#deleteTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` and
`Model#getTutorialClass()`respectively.


Given below is an example of how the tutorial class features can be used:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueTUtorialClassList` would be derived from the 
initial ClassMATE state, and all tutorial classes stored will be displayed.

Step 2. The user executes an `addc c/G00 s/Tues 12 - 2pm` command. The `addc` command calls `Model#addTutorialClass()`, adding a new tutorial class to Classmate. This modifies and saves the
state of ClassMATE. The updated `UniqueTutorialClassList` will be displayed in the `ClassListPanel`
to the user.

Step 3. The user executes a `findc G00` command. The `findc` command calls the `Model#updateFilteredTutorialClassList()`, modifying the state of the filtered list
of tutorial classes. The updated filtered list consisting of te results of the search query will be displayed to the user.

Step 4. The user executes a  `viewc 1` command. The `viewc` command updates the `FilteredList` of `TutorialCLass`es to only display the class at the
given index, and updates the `FilteredList` of `Students` to contain only the students who are in the selected class. The updated filtered list of
students and tutorial classes will be displayed to the user.

Step 5. The user executes a `deletec 2` command. The `deletec` command calls `Model#deleteTutorialCLass()`, modifying and saving the
state of ClassMATE by deleting the class stored at the given index in the `UniqueTutorialClassList`. This updated list will be displayed to the user.

Step 6. The user executes a `listc` command. The `listc` command calls `Model#getTutorialClassList()` modifying and saving the state of the `FilteredList`
to contain all tutorial classes in ClassMATE. This updated list will be displayed to the user.



Using the example of the `AddClassCommand`,
when the user enters the `addc` command to add a tutorial class, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in [Section 3.3, “Logic component”](#33-logic-component).
During the parsing, a new TutorialClass instance is created. This `TutorialClass` instance will be received by the `AddClassCommand` when it is created.

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarises the aforementioned steps.

![AddClassSequenceDiagram](images/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Execution of the `AddClassCommand`

#### Design Considerations

#####Aspect: Finding Tutorial Classes
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Find Tutorial Classes by selecting all classes with classcodes matching the search keyword
    * Pros: Shorter keyword to type, therefore increasing user typing speed. User is also able to 
    find multiple classes
    * Cons: Lower Accuracy in searching for a specific class, having to search through multiple classes
    
* Alternative 2: Find tutorial class by exact classcode
    * Pros: Higher Accuracy in search
    * Cons: Takes longer for user to type commands, less user friendly
